### Opinion Monitoring Platform - _(Custom Project)_

#### 1. Background

In public discussions running over longer periods of time, it often
happens that some participants significantly change their opinions on
the subject.
A popular example, is the reactor explosion in Fukushima, totally
turning around the plans of the german government concerning the future
of nuclear power plants.
Moreover, it often happens that members of the same interest group have
contradicting views. For instance, certain members of the german party
SPD called for a fast implementation of the concept of
"Vorratsdatenspeicherung" after the attacks on the french satirical
magazine "Charlie Hebdo" (January 2015), while other members strongly
object to this idea.

Such changes are usually difficult to keep track of as an individual,
because media covers only the last few weeks of events.
It would be nice to have a platform, which makes it easy to document
contradictions or changes happening in the opinion of politicians or
other public entities, allowing to measure characteristics like
*trustworthyness* or *consistency of opinions* as well as *linking
specific events to changes of opinion*.

#### 2. Project Idea

The idea is to design a web platform, which allows to select statements of
public entities from different sources (e.g. a part of a YouTube video,
a quote in a news article or magazine, wiki entry etc.) and to relate
them with one another in a meaningful way.
This can be done by unexperienced users in a graphical user interface.
The steps may be as follows:

1.  The user specifies the question of the discussion. He can choose from
    existing questions or add a new one (works similar to tagging in
    Twitter).
2.  The user selects statements of one or more persons to the question.
3.  The user enters relationships between those statements, such as
    - *contradiction:* statement contradicts either
        * prior statements of the same person or
        * statements of members of the same interest group (e.g. political party or
        * a well known fact (referenced by a reliable source)

    - *answer:* statement answers another statement (maybe of another
      person)
    - *criticizes:* statement critizes statement of another person
    - *etc.*

By use of a database different filters on the data are possible, e.g.
