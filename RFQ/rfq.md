###Network Manager - _(Custom Project)_
#### Background

Computer networking is difficult and even though the Linux kernel, device
drivers and additional modules like the wpa\_supplicant already offer some kind 
of "high level" abstract interface, most users will be bugged
by manually configuring even the simplest kinds of (wireless) networks.
This is where a network manager comes in handy - a user friendly utility
to keep track of the various configurations and settings needed so that
even techically unaware personnel is enabled to set up and administer
network devices.
